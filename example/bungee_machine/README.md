# Bungee Machine Setup  

Run the script in `setup.sh`, after updating the links not provided. 
What the script does is:   

- Downloads BungeeCord, and creates a script to run it  
- Downloads the DormantServer plugin, and preloads a config to it 

A sample `config.yml` can be found in the main readme file of this repository. 

Instead of using a download link, you can make the file yourself, or send it over via SFTP, as it's generally not 
a good idea to have your API keys floating around the internet.
